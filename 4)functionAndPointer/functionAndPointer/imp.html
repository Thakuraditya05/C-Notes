Summary for a 64-bit system:
int: 4 bytes
float: 4 bytes
double: 8 bytes
long: 8 bytes
long long: 8 bytes
bool: 1 byte (though typically it is 1 byte, but the exact size can vary with different compilers)
char: 1 byte
Pointer size: 8 bytes
The 64-bit architecture mostly impacts pointer sizes and the size of long and long long, but other basic types (like int and float) are typically unaffected by the architecture.
